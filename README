SIMPLY COMPLICATED MUSIC
========================

- Play a sound every so many units of time.
- Pick different gaps for different sounds.
- Primes might sound nice.
- Should result in paterns that are complex but still recognisably regular.
- Drum beats should work.

5/7 should result in:
!    . |  .   | .    . |   .  | .    !    . |  .   |.    . |   .  | .    !    . |  .   |.    .|   .  | .

To Run
------
Will only run on OS X because it's using afplay.

  lein repl play-sounds.clj


Notes
-----
I initially tried to get the sounds playing with clojure or java libraries
rather than shelling out. Unfortunately after a little research it looked like
the libraries out there were verbose and unnessisarily complex, for my needs at
least.
